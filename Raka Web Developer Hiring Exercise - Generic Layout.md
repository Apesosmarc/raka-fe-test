# Development Exercise: Generic Layout


## Objective
Show us your web dev skills and thought process. 

Raka's developers work with designers to translate the designer's comps into real-life websites.
  
## Requirements
* Styles should use SCSS and be compiled down to CSS. We typically use Laravel Mix or Gulp, but use whichever method of compilation you're comfortable with.
* The page should look correct and work well in all modern browsers (we don't care about IE).
* The page should be responsive across screen sizes from 375px wide to 2560px wide. A Raka developer strives to match the comp as close to pixel-perfect as possible. However, we might only be working from a desktop design, so the developer sometimes makes decisions on how to best reflow the layout for different screen sizes.
* *Interactions* – any interactions and progressive enhancements are usually brainstormed with the team and implemented by the dev. Some interactions are shown in the comp, however, since you're working in a silo, feel free to add whatever other interactions or sizzle that you deem fit.

## Timeframe
**Spend up to 6 hours** taking this design comp as far as you can...or want to. We're really looking for insight into your work style and thought process.
 
It's not required that you finish the whole page and we won't judge you for not finishing. Rather, we want to see your work process and organization in as real a way possible. 

## What To Do
1. Download the attached Figma file, `Raka-Dev-Project.fig`. We also provided a static jpg if that's easier.
2. Per the objectives above, translate that design comp into mark-up – an actual web page, or part of the page with all the HTML, CSS, JS, and anything else you want.
3. Try to stick to the timeframe above. We'd rather see a realistic representation of what you can do in the allotted time even if it's not quite where you want it to be.
4. Share your work with us.
	1. Zip up all your work and send us the project in it's entirety. We'll need all the assets, compiled files etc, with the expectation that we can just drag your `index.html` file into a local browser and have it all work.
	2. Share a git repo via GitHub, Bitbucket, etc. with all of the project files including any other necessary information.

### Notes
If you have a favorite starting point, please use it. We don't expect you to start from absolutely nothing. 

If you have any questions at all, definitely reach out to ask.
